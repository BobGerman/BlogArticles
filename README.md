# There's nothing to see here folks!

This repo is where I develop new blog articles. It's public so I can invite people to review my drafts. I always make final edits in the target blog editor - so any articles you see here will be in draft form.

Please visit my blog!

* Articles from 2015-present are at my current blog: https://bob1german.com (I always cross-post here when I write for other blogs)
* Articles from 2006-2015 are at my old MSDN blog: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bobgerman/?WT.mc_id=m365-0000-rogerman. This blog platform is being retired, so I will no longer post or approve comments on this platform.

Thanks!
